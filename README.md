# KarutaSoda (Karuta Bot Cheats)
## DISCLAIMER
This bot doesn't work anymore. If you try to use it, you'll either get banned from Discord, because self-bots are against the TOS, or you'll be banned from the Karuta bot.
I had never gain profit from the selling of this software and I'm posting it just to display something on my GitHub.
I enjoyed coding this bot more than playing the actual game, but now that the bot protection is more strict (finally, good for them), I'll stop developing this project. You're free to try it out at your own risk, but I won't explain how to install it: you'll have to figure it out yourself.

## What's Karuta Bot?
Karuta is a collectible card bot powered by Discord that currently features more than 78,000 anime characters. It turns these characters into unique collectibles that you can earn, customize, upgrade, trade, and more!
For more info check [their page at top.gg](https://top.gg/bot/646937666251915264).

## How it works?
Given a bunch of discord user token and 3 channels (one to drop, one to trade and one to use other Karuta commands) for each token, you can run multiple accounts to farm cards and items. The first account is called _master_: every other account will trade, at semi-random times, cards and items to him, so you can trade back to you everything by logging on only one extra account.
You can have multiple masters and make them trade to each other by commands.

## How do I set it up?
You'll have to dig the code if you really want to use it. It doesn't work anymore so it's useless to explain it.

## What commands can I use?
Again, you'll have to dig the code a bit.

**I won't explain how it works or how to use it**.
